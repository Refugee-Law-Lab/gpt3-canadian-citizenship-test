    "NOTE: This is an update of a prior version of this notebook that used GPT-3\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the requirements to obtain Canadian citizenship is to pass a multiple-choice test that that involves questions about Canadian history, geography, economy, government, laws, and important symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Details about the test, along with a study guide, are available [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-test.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The original notebook, *Can_gpt_pass_citizenship_test.ipynb*, examines whether, as of January 2023, OpenAI's GPT-3 could pass the citizenship test without any fine-tuning, using 60 practice questions made available by the [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/new-to-canada/citizenship.jsp). This notebook does the same using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 as of February 28, 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can scrape practice questions and answers from the Toronto Public Library's website by running the *ScrapeCitizenshipTest.py* file from a terminal (scraping uses playwright, which does not work well in Jupyter Notebook):\n",
    "\n",
    ">pip install pandas\n",

    ">pip install playwright\n",
    ">\n",
    ">playwright install\n",
    ">\n",
    ">python -m ScrapeCitizenshipTest\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can run the notebook using the Excel file with the scraped data in this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements for the notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    ">pip install pandas\n",
    "> \n",

    ">\n",
    ">pip install tqdm\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebook, you will also need an API key from OpenAI. Details about obtaining an account are [here](https://beta.openai.com/signup), and details about getting an API key are [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key). Once you have an API key, you can load it locally using python-dotenv or you can load using google colab secrets if you are using colab.\n",
