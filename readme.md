One of the requirements to obtain Canadian citizenship is to pass a multiple-choice test that that involves questions about Canadian history, geography, economy, government, laws, and important symbols.

Details about the test, along with a study guide, are available [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-citizenship/become-canadian-citizen/citizenship-test.html).

The notebook, *Can_gpt_pass_citizenship_test.ipynb*, examines whether, as of January 2023, OpenAI's GPT-3 can pass the citizenship test without any fine-tuning, using 60 practice questions made available by the [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/new-to-canada/citizenship.jsp). 

The notebook, *Can_gpt_pass_citizenship_test-v2-GPT4.ipynb*, examines whether, as of February 2024, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can pass the citizenship test without any fine-tuning, using 60 practice questions made available by the [Toronto Public Library](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/new-to-canada/citizenship.jsp).
